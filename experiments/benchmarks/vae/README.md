# InfoMax Variational Auto Encoder (InfoMaxVAE)

The InfoMaxVAE is a variational autoencoder which uses insights from information theory to improve the learned latent space representation.

### Training and Evaluation
We adapt the original implementation of [InfoMax Variational Autoencoder](https://github.com/AliLotfi92/InfoMaxVAE) by A.L. Rezaabad and S. Vishwanath. To train and evaluate the models on a cluster, execute the corresponding .sh script in [experiments/cluster](experiments/cluster).
